# VBA-challenge
Homework2.0 Repository
This workbook will contain all the files necessary to begin my VBA challenge.

## Files
  -Test Data
  -Stock Data

# Instructions

Create a script that will loop through all the stocks for one year for each run and take the following information.

The ticker symbol.

Yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

The percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

The total stock volume of the stock.

You should also have conditional formatting that will highlight positive change in green and negative change in red.

The result should look as follows.
(image should be here)

Make the appropriate adjustments to your VBA script that will allow it to run on every worksheet, i.e., every year, just by running the VBA script once.

Other Considerations

Use the sheet alphabetical_testing.xlsx while developing your code. This data set is smaller and will allow you to test faster. Your code should run on this file in less than 3-5 minutes.


Make sure that the script acts the same on each sheet. The joy of VBA is to take the tediousness out of repetitive task and run over and over again with a click of the button.
